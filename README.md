- View: The UI layer that displays the data to the user and handles user input. In this app, the views are implemented using Bloc Builder and Consumer patterns.
- Cubit: The cubit layer manages the methods and initial data handling. Additionally, the cubit handles the various state methods that are to be called.
- State: The state file manages the different states of the application which include but not limited to initial, loading, success or failure. These can be defined as enums to handle the state.
- Repository: The repository contains the methods that interact with the different network services. The repository contains various methods which are defined according to the cubit.
